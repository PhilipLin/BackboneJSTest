BackboneJSTest
==============
Just Experimenting with BackboneJS, focusing on abstraction and good design, so it can be scalable.

For example, rather than rending the whole txt file, it only renders whats displayed on the screen.

This allows for good scaling, so we do not have for example 100000 divs displaying text on the screen. We only have around 20 divs, depending on the window size.
